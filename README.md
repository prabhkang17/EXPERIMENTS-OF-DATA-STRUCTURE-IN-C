This repository contains a collection of C programming experiments and assignments that demonstrate various fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. Each experiment focuses on implementing and understanding key operations and logic in C.

ðŸ”¬ Experiments Included:
Program to prompt the user to enter marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects and calculate the total and average.

Linear Search:
Implementation of the linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.

Binary Search:
Efficient searching technique using binary search on a sorted array.

Linked List Operations:
Program to create a linked list and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Stack Operations:
Stack implementation using arrays or linked lists with operations like push, pop, and display.

Insertion Sort:
Sorting an array using the insertion sort algorithm.

Bubble Sort:
Sorting an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

Binary Search Tree (BST):

Traversing a BST (inorder, preorder, postorder)

Inserting a node into the BST

Depth First Search (DFS):
Implementation of DFS traversal on a graph.

Breadth First Search (BFS):
Implementation of BFS traversal on a graph.
